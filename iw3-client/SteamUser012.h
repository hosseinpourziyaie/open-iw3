	// If false, it means there is no active connection due to either a networking issue on the local machine, or the Steam server is down/busy.
	// The Steam client will automatically be trying to recreate the connection as often as possible.

	// Multiplayer Authentication functions

	// InitiateGameConnection() starts the state machine for authenticating the game client with the game server

	//
	// Parameters:
	// void *pAuthBlob - a pointer to empty memory that will be filled in with the authentication token.
	// int cbMaxAuthBlob - the number of bytes of allocated memory in pBlob. Should be at least 2048 bytes.
	// CSteamID steamIDGameServer - the steamID of the game server, received from the game server by the client
	// CGameID gameID - the ID of the current game. For games without mods, this is just CGameID( <appID> )
	// uint32 unIPServer, uint16 usPortServer - the IP address of the game server
	// bool bSecure - whether or not the client thinks that the game server is reporting itself as secure (i.e. VAC is running)
	//
	// return value - returns the number of bytes written to pBlob. If the return is 0, then the buffer passed in was too small, and the call has failed
	// The contents of pBlob should then be sent to the game server, for it to use to complete the authentication process.
