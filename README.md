- some other visual improvements

# Known Issue

- infoResponse string does not have pair for clients count; fixed by ignoring from dpmaster data check for now

# Notes

- OSW for cod4 is something quite un-necessary. this project meant to be multi-functional at first. I mean it would have worked for various cods beside cod4

# TODO

- Add LocalizedStrings Patch maybe?
